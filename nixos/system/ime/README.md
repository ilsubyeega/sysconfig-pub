# IME (Input Method Editor)
  Writing non-English lanugaes requires an additional IME setup. 
  This directory have two IME configration: `fcitx5`, `kime`

## Modules

  ### fcitx5
    This will mostly work.

  ### kime
    Korean only purpose IME. Should be tested.

## Notes

  ### GNOME may not able to use `kime`
    Looks like they are using `ibus` only. See following:
